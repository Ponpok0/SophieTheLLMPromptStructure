# Original Sophie README
## Introduction

This prompt was designed specifically for ChatGPT 4o, with control prompts integrated into all input fields. Personal information has been removed, leaving an almost completely original version. These changes should not affect the logical output.

## Important Notes

### Language Considerations
* **Japanese-centric design**: This prompt is primarily written in Japanese. Without adding language-specific instructions, it will likely respond in Japanese. Even if you change the language in Custom Instructions, some hardcoded Japanese text may still appear in responses.
* **Cultural adaptation**: The Japanese version uses grammatically soft expressions to balance the logically strict and critical output. In other languages like English, this can result in excessively harsh responses. Adjustments may be needed for non-Japanese use.

### Platform Compatibility

**ChatGPT 4o (Recommended)**
* This prompt is specifically designed for ChatGPT 4o
* Best compatibility and intended behavior

**Memory Function Limitations**
* ChatGPT's current "Memory" feature tends to over-summarize markdown-structured content
* Reproduction in current ChatGPT may be difficult
* **Recommended approach**: Use GPTs with Custom Instructions + Knowledge (attached files) for easier installation
* Note: GPTs behavior differs slightly from WebUI - responses may be slightly more casual

**GPT-5**
* Command influence differs significantly
* Responses may feel awkward/stiff
* Instruction intensity is too high for GPT-5
* Requires softening of command expressions for proper use

**Gemini**
* Based on testing, almost no compatibility
* Migration not recommended

**Claude (Alternative Recommendation)**
* Large Custom Instructions capacity makes migration easier
* Similar to GPT-5, prompt influence is very strong
* Excessive stiffness and harshness in responses
* Strongly recommend adjusting for softer expressions before use

## Usage Recommendations

For the most authentic Sophie experience:
1. Use **ChatGPT 4o** (WebUI or GPTs)
2. If using other models, expect significant adjustments will be needed
3. For non-ChatGPT platforms, Claude offers the best migration path (with modifications)
